# Introduction
We present measurements.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region but continental-scale measurements had not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.

# methodology
we compared our measurements of particle aging with a model simulation. Model is from smith et al

# Results
The simulations indicate that coagulation is the dominant growth mechanism for the particles.
